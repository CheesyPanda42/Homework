Vacuum-cleaner project
</title>

<body>
For this assignment you have to implement a vacuum-cleaner agent. 

<br>
<a href=".">files</a>
<br>
<a href="project.zip">zipped files</a>

<p>
<b>Environment</b>
<br>
The environment for the agent is a rectangular grid containing 
<ul>
 <li> walls - marked as <tt>'#'</tt>
 <li> dirt  - marked as <tt>'*'</tt>
 <li> home position - marked as <tt>'H'</tt>
</ul>
Some properties:
<ul>
 <li> cell containing a wall cannot contain any other object
 <li> there is no more than one "dirt" in each cell
 <li> home position is arbitrary - but not inside a wall
</ul>

<p>
<b>Agent</b>
<br>
Agent design is completely up to you. See <tt>agent.cpp</tt> and <tt>agent.h</tt> for an example, check <tt>definitions.h</tt> for notations. Study <tt>environment.cpp</tt> and <tt>environment.h</tt>.
<br>Agent start position (home position) and initial heading (orientation) are arbitrary - see file format description.

<p>
<b>Actions</b>
<br>
<ul>
 <li> left
 <li> right
 <li> forward
 <li> suck
 <li> shutoff
 <li> noop
</ul>

<p>
<b>Agent termination</b>
<br>
Environment is running in a loop till one of the following happens
<ul>
 <li> agent executes <tt>shutoff</tt>
 <li> agent performs <tt>max_steps</tt> (see <tt>definitions.h</tt>, currently set to 10000.
</ul>


<p>
<b>Performance measure</b>
<br>
Agents performance is calculated as follows:
unless agent is "OFF" it's <tt>score</tt> is 
<br>
number of collected dirt multiplied by 20 minus the number of steps (actions)
<br>
that is if after 125 steps you have collected 7 "dirts" agent's score is <tt>20*7-125 = 15</tt>
<br>
when agent executes <tt>shutoff</tt>, it gets additional 1000 points if it's in "home cell".

<p>
<b>Percept</b>
<br>
See <tt>definitions.h</tt>:
<ul>
 <li> dirt - boolean - if there is dirt in this cell
 <li> bump - boolean - if agent bumped to a wall during previous move
 <li> home boolean - if this is a home position
</ul>

<p>
<b>Environment file format</b>
<br>
Mostly self-explanatory,
<ul>
 <li> <tt>'#'</tt> wall
 <li> <tt>'.'</tt> nothing
 <li> <tt>'*'</tt> dirt
 <li> <tt>'&gt;'</tt> agent start/home position, orientation EAST
 <li> <tt>'&lt;'</tt> agent start/home position, orientation WEST
 <li> <tt>'^'</tt> agent start/home position, orientation NORTH
 <li> <tt>'V'</tt> agent start/home position, orientation SOUTH
</ul>

<p>
<b>Submission</b>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>ANSI C++. 
 <li>files - <tt>agent.h</tt> and <tt>agent.cpp</tt>.  <tt>README</tt> - short description of your agent design (ASCII).
 <li>notice that you <b>DO NOT</b> submit  <tt>environment.*</tt>,  <tt>driver.cpp</tt> and <tt>definitions.h</tt>. You may modify them while you debug, but before submitting make sure your code works with the original files.
</ul>

<br>My scores for the first 5 fields: 1070, 993, 1034, 1027, 1127
